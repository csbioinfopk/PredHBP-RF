Hormone-binding proteins (HBPs) are carrier proteins that bind to particular hormones with specificity. Hormone signaling is modulated or inhibited by a soluble carrier hormone binding protein (HBP) that can interact non-covalently and specifically with growth hormone. Despite being still poorly understood, HBP is crucial for life's development. According to some data, several diseases are brought on by the abnormal expression of HBPs. The first step in exploring HBPs' functions and comprehending their biological mechanisms is to accurately recognize these molecules. Accurate HBP determination from a given protein sequence offers crucial hints for comprehending cell development and cellular mechanisms. Due to high experimental costs and lengthy experiment periods, it is challenging to correctly identify HBPs from an increasing number of proteins using conventional biochemical experiments.
